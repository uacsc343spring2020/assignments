## Project Milestone 4

**Note, it may be that some team members are unable to participate due to COVID-19 related changes (e.g., Internet access, illnness, need to care for family). It may be that you do not complete as much of this milestone as you wanted due to COVID-19 related changes to your obligations. We are aware of this. It will not be counted against any team. Please prioritize health and family.**

Version History: 

- Revised 2020/3/20 - Some added notes
- Revised 2020/3/11 - Extend Deadline to March 22
- Revised 2020/2/25 - Fix typo
- Released 2020/2/23

The team portion of this milestone is due Sunday March 22, 11:59 PM (group)
and thirty minutes later for the indvidual portion.

In this milestone we are:

- Design an observational evaluation for your paper prototype
- Conduct the observational evaluation you designed.
- Analyzing the results of the evaluation 
- Reporting on the results of your analysis
- Individually stating your contributions and the contributions of your team
  members to this milestone.

The HTML, Javascript, and CSS should be in separate files. No style
information should be in the HTML tags outside of a style attribute. Do not
use HTML tags like `<center>`, `<b>`, or `<i>` to alter visual appearance. Avoid the
use of CSS `position: fixed`; because it may cause elements to overlap and be
unreadable on the grader's setup.

Please continue to use the same name that you used in PM3.


Create a team repository:
[https://classroom.github.com/g/H0KG46Br](https://classroom.github.com/g/H0KG46Br).
At the time of submission should contain one HTML file named `PM4.html.` It
should also include any CSS files, Javascript files, images or media needed
for the report and `PM4.html`. 

Use the following link to create your individual github repository for this
assignment:
[https://classroom.github.com/a/aen03mo9](https://classroom.github.com/a/aen03mo9).
At the time of submission, it should contain a text file named
`PM4-evaluations.txt.` The file should have the content described under
Individual Evaluations below. This is a similar format used in PM3 with one
change. See bolded comments below.  Also, the notes on how you may want to
distribute the work are different. 

### Conducting the Evaluations

You should conduct the evaluation on one person for each team member.
Therefore, if your group has 3 people, you will conduct 3 evaluations. If your
group has 4 people, you will conduct 4 evaluations. Not every team member must
be present at every evaluation but **each team member must participate in at
least one observation session in some role (e.g., facilitator, observer).**

The observation should be done with a paper prototype where the participant
interacts with the prototype. Showing a participants a movie of the prototype
and asking for their reactions is not sufficient for this assignment. 

The materials related to your evaluation should be included as below:


### Content 

#### Header Information

At the top of your report, state the names of all the team members as well as
your team name. Also include an image of your paper prototype design. 

#### Section I: Observation Design (30 pts)

Create a section that includes your briefing and de-briefing scripts, a
description of your tasks (what you will ask them to do), and a list of your
interview questions for the observation. Each of these four artifacts should
be clearly separated from each other so they can be differentiated. Giving
them subheaders or otherwise labeling them will help.

Focus on the task of: 

1. MENU: Ordering a meal.
2. GAME: Choosing an piece of armor/accessory to equip. 

You will be graded on the appropriateness of these materials. You may include
a Rationale sub-section to explain any choices you made.

#### Section III: Observational Analysis (25 pts)

After conducting the observations, analyze the results of the observations and
report on the analysis as described in Lectures 12 and 13.


#### Section III: Suggestions for Improvement (10 pts)

Based on the analysis of the previous section, create a prioritized list of
suggestions for improvements upon the design. Included in these suggestions
may be design elements that should not change. Explain the prioritization.

#### Appendix: Observation Artifacts (20 pts)

Your observation artifacts should be included in the report. Artifacts can
include raw notes, audio, visual, etc. If you recorded audio or visual but
your participants would prefer these not be shared, a transcript should be
included. 

Each observation session should produce some of its own artifacts and these
should be clearly differentiated from each other so an outsider (like the
grader) can know which artifacts go with which session. 

The team members participating in each observation should be listed with the
artifacts along with their role for that observation.  

You will be graded on the appropriateness of these artifacts in terms of level
of detail and clear separation of facts from inference.


### Format (5 pts)

The only constraints on the format, other than those described above, as are
in PM3:

- The report should be reasonably readable. For example, black text on a black
  background is not reasonable. 
- The headers should be differentiable from the body text and spacing should
  be used to help readability.
- There should be some persistent way for me to navigate between sections.
- The title should have your group name.  
- The report content should be 640 pixels wide with a 12 point sans-serif
  font for the report text.



### Individual Evaluations (5 pts)

This content should be written by each individual after the project milestone is
submitted. Use the separate individual github classroom link.

At the top of your evaluation, estimate the distribution of work contributed
by yourself and your teammates. You will do this by starting with 20 units for
each members of your team (a total of 60 for a 3 person team, 80 for a 4
person team). You will then apportion the units to yourself and your team
members to indicate distribution. If everyone has 20 unit, that means equal
distribution.

We will assess the distributions listed as well as the contributions described
for balance and may apply a weighting/scaling factor to individual grades to
account for discrepancies. More work does not necessarily mean a higher
grade--taking over the project and influencing others to not participate is
discouraged.


Example:
```
Unit Distribution

Blinky: 17

Pinky: 21

Inky: 22

Clyde: 20

```

**If the distribution is largely uneven, please make a note as to why it
was not evenly apportioned and what was done to try to divide it evenly.**

**Note, it may be that some team members are unable to participate due to COVID-19 related changes (e.g., Internet access, illnness, need to care for family). This will not be counted against any team. Please prioritize health and family.**

The second paragraph should describe what your contributions to the project
milestone were:

```
Individual Contributions -- FamilyName, GivenName

My contributions were...
```

Then, for each of your team members, write a section headed with their name
explaining what their contributions were and rating them on:

1. Quality of Work
2. Timeliness of Work Completion
3. Contributions to Group Discussion
4. Cooperative and Supportive Attitude

Ratings should be one of [Below Expectations, Good, Above and Beyond]. 

Beneath the ratings you may provide more detail explaining your ratings or any
other information we should know.


Example:
```
Peer Assessment -- FamilyName, GivenName

GivenName's contributions were... 

1. Quality of Work: Above and Beyond

2. Timeliness of Work Completion: Below Expectations

3. Contributions to Group Discussion: Good

4. Cooperative and Supportive Attitude: Good

GivenName did a great job on the paper prototype but was two days later than
we planned so we had to scramble to make the movie.
```

### Distribution (5 pts)

All team members should participate in the discussion of evaluation design,
observations themselves, and suggestions for improvement. At least two team
members should participate in the analysis.

The team should strive to apportion equitably. It is up to the team how this
can be done. 

It may help to appoint different people to draft each writing section and then
someone else to check/edit the writing for completeness. Similarly, one person
can be in charge of assembling the webpage and another in charge of checking
it for compliance. 

One way to divide up the observations is to have each team member recruit one
participant and then act as facilitator for that participant and then observer
on someone else's participant. However, if this proves difficult for a team
member, the work can be divided up differently with the team member
participating less in the observations doing more work on the analysis,
writing, and/or web page assembly.
